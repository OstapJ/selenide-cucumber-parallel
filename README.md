Selenide examples: Cucumber
========================

This is a sample project demonstrating how to use Selenide with Cucumber and Maven.

Currently it shows why you DON'T want to run Cucumber tests in parallel: because you can't get a good HTML report.

### How to run

To run Selenide+Cucumber tests, just type from command line:

```
mvn verify
```

### How to add project to IDEA

1. Run the following command to fetch dependencies: `mvn`
2. Add module `cucumber.iml` to your Intellij IDEA.
